- Simulator
    / Simulator class
        - Basic tests
    / Message transmission
        Don't use raw bytes, simplify by wrapping in objects and allow receivers to pattern match them (or something like that)
    - Nodes and algorithms for nodes to execute
        Should this be two separate things or should I keep them as linked ideas
    / Logging
        - Tests
    - Network behaviours
        / Reliable links - message received iff it is sent. Might be reordered
            / Tests
        / Fair-loss links - messages might be lost, duplicated or reordered but will eventually get through
            / Tests
        - Arbitrary links - messages might be altered
            - Tests
    / Timing behaviours for messages
        / Synchronous - latency no greater than known upper bound
            / Tests
        / Partially-synchronous - can become asynchronous for finite but unknown periods of time
            / Tests
    - Node behaviours
        - Crash-stop
            - Tests
        - Crash-recovery
            - Tests
    - Timing behaviours for node execution
        - Synchronous - nodes execute at known speed
            - Tests
        - Partially-synchronous - can become asynchronous for finite but unknown periods of time
            - Tests
        - Asynchronous - execution may be paused for arbitrarily long
            - Tests
/ Example simple read-only sharded key-value store
- Example distributed database system
    - Tests
- Raft algorithm
    - Tests
- Graphical interface? (probably not)
